The Wicki Lab (at the University Hospital of Zurich) and the Krauthammer lab (at the University of Zurich) are seeking a motivated PhD candidate to join a recently established team from both labs working on the AI Tumorboard project improving precision oncology. The candidate will apply and develop novel AI approaches for the analysis of multi-omic data to advance cancer treatment decisions.

### Your Responsibilities

The goal of this position is to combine genomics and machine-learning approaches to improve personalised cancer care. Key focus areas are:

- Genomic foundation models for processing multi-omic data of cancer patients.
- Liquid biopsy for disease monitoring.
- Combining multi-omics and clinical data to support treatment decisions.
- Collaborating closely with oncologists and data scientists to align data analysis tools with clinical workflows and real-world needs.   

You also have the possibilities to expand the research scope to other innovative projects in Precision Oncology.

### Your Profile

Minimum qualifications:
- Masterâ€™s degree (MSc) in computational biology, bioinformatics, biology, statistics, machine-learning or a related discipline with proven experience in both genomic and computational projects.
- Proficiency in Python and core scientific computing libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, pandas).
- Strong statistical background and experience with machine learning methods.
- Strong foundational knowledge of cancer biology and genomics.

Preferred qualifications:
- Proficiency in Linux systems, and high-performance computing (HPC) environments.
- Experience with NGS analysis and with bioinformatic tools
- Experience with deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow).
- Familiarity with multi-modal data integration (e.g., clinical, genomics, proteomics).

### What We Offer
- Access to state-of-the-art computational resources, clinical datasets, and expert medical collaborators.
- An opportunity to work on cutting-edge bioinformatic and machine-learning projects with real-world impact in Oncology.
- A stimulating, interdisciplinary research environment within the University of Zurich and the University Hospital of Zurich.
- Competitive salary and support for attending conferences and publishing in top-tier journals.
- Outstanding working conditions in the vibrant city of Zurich, Switzerland.

### Place of Work
Zurich, Switzerland

### Start of Employment
The preferred start date is Q2 of 2025.
