We are currently looking for Master's students in the field of **Bioinformatics** for the topic of

### Nucleosome footprints in cell-free DNA sequencing data

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is released by dying cells into the surrounding tissues and also to the bloodstream. As nucleosomes protect DNA from degradation, plasma cfDNA carries information about the nucleosome organization in the cells of origin. Different characteristics of cfDNA are increasingly being used in the diagnostics of genetic diseases and the monitoring of cancer. We discern nucleosome footprints at transcription binding sites and DNase hypersensitivity sites from cfDNA-sequencing data and infer the contribution of different cell / tissue types to cfDNA. In doing so, we aim to quantify cancer-derived cfDNA and detect inflammation in various tissue types.

We are looking for students who have some experience with Unix systems, proficiency in at least one scripting language (e.g. Python or R), a strong understanding of biostatistics and a basic understanding of machine learning algorithms.
Depending on the experience and interest of the student we offer projects focusing on:
- Representation learning or
- Gene expression inference from cfDNA-sequencing data or
- Chromatin foundation models

You can apply by sending a CV to this <a href="#" onclick="u='zsolt.balazs'; d='uzh.ch'; prompt('Copy address to clipboard',u+'@'+d); return false">e-mail</a> along with a short description of your motivation to join our lab.
