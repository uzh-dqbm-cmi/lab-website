We optimized the TnpB system from Deinococcus radiodurans into the enhanced TnpBmax for superior performance in mammalian cells, leading to a 4.4-fold average improvement. A large dataset of 10,211 target sites was used to train the TEEP deep learning model, which predicts ωRNA activity with high accuracy (r>0.8). This tool facilitates the application of TnpB as an ultracompact programmable endonuclease, demonstrating high editing efficiencies in both murine liver and brain in vivo.
