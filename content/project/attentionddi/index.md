The AttentionDDI model presents a method utilizing attention-based deep learning to predict adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) by modeling complex relationships between drugs. This approach addresses the critical safety challenge where existing models often fail to capture non-linear, semantic features of drugs effectively. AttentionDDI leverages drug features like chemical structure and target information to achieve superior predictive performance, ultimately enhancing patient safety.
