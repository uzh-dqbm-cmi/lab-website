Generative AI for protein fitness optimization

This project explores generative modeling for optimizing protein fitness, such as stability, binding affinity, or enzymatic activity. A machine learning-based prior over protein sequences is combined with a property prediction model that guides generation toward high-fitness sequences. The resulting variational framework, VLGPO, can generate new candidate protein sequences predicted to exhibit higher fitness. (read more here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19200)
