Earlier this autumn, we took some time to unwind and connect outside the lab — welcoming new members and enjoying a couple of cozy outings together. We started with an evening at Frau Gerold’s Garden, sharing good food and drinks while getting to know our newest colleagues. Shortly after, a group set off for an after-work hike up to Üetliberg, where we rewarded ourselves with drinks and the city view. We’re also very proud of Xiaochen for successfully defending his PhD — a milestone we were happy to celebrate together with him!

In September we gathered at Frau Gerold’s Garden for a relaxed evening of good food and drinks — the perfect setting to welcome our newest lab members.

Later that month, a group of us set off after work on an adventurous hike up to Uetliberg. We enjoyed well-earned drinks at the top and soaked in the evening panorama over Zürich.
