abstract: "High cell viability and recovered cell concentration are typical quality control requirements for single-cell processing and quality data. This protocol describes procedures for sampling, live-cell biobanking, preprocessing for single-cell RNA sequencing, and analysis of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) samples of the skin. The minimally invasive nature of FNA collection is more accepted by patients and allows for frequent longitudinal sampling, resulting in high-quality single-cell sequencing data that capture cellular heterogeneity in clinical samples."
