I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry at the University of Zurich. As part of my Master’s program in Bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham, I will be working for six months in the Krauthammer Lab to conduct my thesis project. My research focuses on deconvoluting cell-free DNA (cfDNA) data to identify cell-type compositions from nucleosome footprints. In my free time, I enjoy being active and spending time in nature.
