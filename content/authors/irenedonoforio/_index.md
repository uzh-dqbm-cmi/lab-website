After completing a BSc in Biotechnology, I decided to transition from the wet lab to the dry lab, fascinated by the potential of computational tools to advance biomedical research. This lead me to pursue an MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Bologna. During my Masterâ€™s, I spent six months at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona, where I focused on studying the early drivers of Mantle Cell Lymphoma formation through omics data analysis.  In August 2025, I joined the Krauthammer Lab, jointly with the Wicki lab at USZ, where I will be working on integrating multi-omics and clinical data to support treatment decisions and implementing computational tools to advance cfDNA analysis. 
In my spare time, I like hiking, dancing, practicing Pilates and reading.
