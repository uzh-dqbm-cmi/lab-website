I am a PhD student working on my thesis Predicting Patient Trajectories in Oncological Surgery at the Technical University of Denmark, in collaboration with the Center for Surgical Science at Zealand University Hospital. I am visiting the Krauthammer lab to collaborate on predicting progression free cancer survival based on NLP-derived data. In my free time, I enjoy reading, knitting and sewing.
