I studied Robotics and Computational Neuroscience at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). During my degree, I spent an exchange year at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and worked as a visiting researcher at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, where I explored manifold learning methods for spatial representations in the brain.

I have been involved in several research projects looking at how AI and machine learning can support innovation in life sciences, oncology and neuroscience. After graduation, I joined inait, a swiss start-up, where I investigated how principles from biology and neuroscience can improve AI algorithms.

Since August 2025, I have been part of the Krauthammer Lab, working on data-driven and machine learning approaches to predict patient outcomes and help advance personalized medical treatments in oncology.

Outside of the lab, you’ll usually find me outdoors — running, xc skiing, or doing other endurance sports.
