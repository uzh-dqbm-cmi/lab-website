I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from the Polytechnic University of Milan, with a transformative Erasmus semester at KU Leuven, where I deepened my expertise in machine learning and AI, and developed an appreciation for Belgian waffles. Passionate about bridging the gap between AI and healthcare, I dedicated my Master‚Äôs thesis to applying reinforcement learning for adaptive models in clinical settings. Since September 2025, I have been part of the Krauthammer Lab, working on protein optimization design and AI-powered radiology tools.

Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking (I am Italian, after all ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and try to make time for the gym, otherwise I‚Äôd never keep up with all that good food!
