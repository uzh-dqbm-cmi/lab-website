I studied Biology for my Bachelor's degree at the University of Zurich (UZH), and I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computational Biology and Bioinfromatics (CBB) at ETH.
I’m excited to join Krauthammer's lab for my master's thesis. Over the next six months, I will be working with cfDNA data for cancer diagnostics under the supervision of Zsolt.
In my free time, I enjoy participating in various sports and activities.
