I studied Biology for my Bachelor's degree at the University of Zurich (UZH), and I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computational Biology and Bioinfromatics (CBB) at ETH.
Iâ€™m excited to join Krauthammer's lab for my master's thesis. Over the next six months, I will be working with cfDNA data for cancer diagnostics under the supervision of Zsolt.
In my free time, I enjoy participating in various sports and activities.
