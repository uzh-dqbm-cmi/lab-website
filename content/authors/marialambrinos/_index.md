My name is Maria Rafaela Lambrinos. I am a master student at the university of Zurich, studying biomedicine. I also did biomedicine at the university of Zurich in my bachelor. I am currently doing my master thesis at the Krauthammer lab. I work with cfDNA sequencing data and my goal is to use this data to differentiate between healthy and cancer samples. I am interested in bioinformatics and cancer genomics. In my free time I like to do body combat and pilates.
