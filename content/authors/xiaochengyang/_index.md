I have an interdisciplinary education background in both biology and data sciences. Now, I am a master student in Computational Biology and Bioninformatics(CBB) programme at ETH.  

At KrauthammerLab, I aim to analyze spatial transcriptomics data of basal-cell carcinoma(BCC). But I am also interested in  the cfDNA field. During my free time, I enjoy not only various sports football, hiking and fishing, but also photography, board games and reading.
