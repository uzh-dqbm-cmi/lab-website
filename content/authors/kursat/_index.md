As part of my Master's program in Bioinformatics at the University of Uppsala, I will be working for six months in the 
Krauthammer Lab to conduct my degree project. My research focuses on identifying accessible chromatin markers for nucleosome 
footprinting using Bulk ATAC-seq data. In my free time, I enjoy being active and spending time in nature.
