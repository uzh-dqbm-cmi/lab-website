I earned a Master's in Computer Science, specializing in Machine Intelligence and Software. After graduation, I completed my remaining 313 days of civil service, applying machine learning to NILM and medical time series. In March 2025, I joined the KrauthammerLab as a PhD student, where I focus on NLP for oncology and radiology.
